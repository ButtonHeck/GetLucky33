GetLucky33
Inspired by SWKOTOR's Pazaak
If you know how to play that in SW - this game wouldn't be new to you :)
the rules are the same, except the score is set to 33

Made with JavaFX, Slick is used to handle sounds
All the sounds were taken from non-commercial sound libraries
Executables folder contains fat jar with linux lwjgl natives, and dedicated .exe for Win with its natives
Have a nice play!
